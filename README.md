## 📚 What's Inside?

### 📂 1. `4-functions-in-c/` — Learn All Function Types with Real Use Cases

This folder contains 4 small logic-based projects, each demonstrating **one type of function** in C:

| Project | Function Type | Parameters | Return Value |
|--------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| 🏦 ATM Withdrawal System | `float withdraw(float, float)` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| 🛒 Shopping Cart Menu | `void displayMenu(void)` | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| 🧾 Simple Billing System | `void printBill(float)` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| 🕹️ XP Calculator | `int getXP(void)` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

Each project includes:
- A meaningful use case
- Clear input/output examples
- Logic explanation and function flow
- MinGW run instructions for Windows

📖 Refer /4-functions-in-c/README.md for full details.

### 📂 2. `employee-management-system/` — Full CRUD Console Project

A simple yet powerful **Employee Management System** (EMS) using `struct` and console menus.

🔧 Features:
- Add Employee with Unique ID check
- Read/Display All Employees
- Update Employee by ID
- Delete Employee by ID (with array shifting)
- Exit

🧠 Concepts Covered:
- `struct` usage
- Array of structures
- Menu-driven logic with switch-case
- Reusability using functions
- Memory management basics

📂 View /employee-management-system/README.md for full explanation, sample output, and how to run.

## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

1. Open terminal or command prompt in the project folder  
2. Compile the code using GCC (MinGW on Windows):

```bash
gcc main.c -o project.exe
./project.exe
```
