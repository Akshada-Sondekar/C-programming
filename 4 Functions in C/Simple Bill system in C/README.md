# 🧾 Simple Billing System in C

This project is a basic C program that simulates a billing system. It uses a function with parameters and no return value to print the final bill including GST.


## 🧠 Learning Purpose

This program was created as part of my learning journey with **C functions**.  
I applied the concept to a **real-world billing system** to better understand how:

- Functions with **parameters** and **no return value** work
- Calculations like **tax (GST)** and total billing are handled
- Clean and readable output formatting is done in the terminal

This logic-based project helped me solidify the understanding of **parameter passing** in C and simulate a simple but practical billing use case.
