# 🕹️ Experience Points (XP) Calculator in C

This project is a simple C program that simulates calculating the **Experience Points** a player earns during a game level. It demonstrates the use of a **function with no parameters and a return value**.

## 🧠 Learning Purpose

This program was created as part of my learning journey with **C functions**.  
I used a **real-world example (gaming XP system)** to apply the concept of:

- Functions with **no parameters** and **return value**
- Clean logic and output formatting
- Building real use cases for better understanding

This is a logic-based project to reinforce **function concepts** in a simple, meaningful way.
