# 🛒 Simple Shopping Cart Menu System in C

This is a basic console-based **shopping cart menu system** implemented in C.  
It uses a function with **no parameters and no return value** to display a user menu.

## 🧠 Learning Purpose

This program was created as part of my learning journey with **C functions**, focusing on the **"no parameter, no return value"** function type.  
It simulates a simple shopping experience with options like:

- Adding items  
- Viewing the cart  
- Proceeding to checkout  

This helped reinforce the concepts of:
- Reusable code through functions
- Menu-driven loops using `while` and `switch-case`
- Clean console-based UI
